<h4>Help map Georgia!</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/41.7157/44.7950&layers=Q">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a> is a project to create a free and open map of the world. It is made by contributors like you. Thousands of users around the world draw roads, buildings, and places of interest to the map, making it better and better over time. If you are new to OSM, visit the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">OSM Wiki</a> to learn more about the project. For new users I have also listed some resources at the bottom of this page to help you get involved.</p>

<p>I am putting together this simple site for OSM contributors to organize mapping efforts a little bit better. I'm interested in Georgia as a whole, but focused mainly on Tbilisi at the moment.</p>

<h3>Map Tbilisi</h3>
<p>In order to have a beautiful, useful, complete map of Tbilisi, I think that we need two things - a simple data model that many contributors can agree on and collect together, and a division of the city into areas under the supervision of different mappers. For example, I am interested in mapping my neighborhood, so I will claim the area that I will cover on the map, and slowly improve the data of that area, using our data model as a guide. Other mappers also claim areas of interest to them, and together we piece together an awesome city map. If you'd like to contribute, please <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/jeffhaack" target="blank">send me a message</a>.<p>
	
View the <a href="progress-map.html">PROGRESS MAP</a>, or take a look at the <a href="data-model.html">DATA MODEL</a>. This is all experimental, so if you have ideas for improving this or things to add to the data model, let me know or please discuss it in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/osmgeorgia/">Facebook group</a>.
